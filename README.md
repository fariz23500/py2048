# py2048
name-Fariz Ali.
The code was written on an adroid app called Pydroid3(as i had no acces to a laptop or a pc).
I have made a code of 2048 game.
The puzzle is controlled by 4 buttons.
w- to shift board upwards.
d-to shift board to the right.
s-to shift board down .
a-to shift board to the left.


The user has to enter the board size and the winning number
The game adds a 2 on any random empty square in the board.
Then the user plays the game.
After every move a random 2 is added to an empty space.
The game runs till the desired winning number is acheived or the user has run out of playable moves.
Please see the gif attached to see the working of my game.
